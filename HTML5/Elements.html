   <header><h2> Looking up this month </h2></header>
   <p>Time for the "dog days" of August! At one time it was thought that the light from the brightest star, Sirius, combined with the light of our Sun to make things hotter. Sirius is no longer in conjunction with the Sun and, you know, I don’t see the light of Sirius, adding much to the Sun, but the story stuck. </p>
   <p>As we begin our August evening, we still find Saturn low in the west-southwest. It’s still there but tougher to see. Saturn’s set time goes from 11pm early in August to 9pm late in the month. On August 3, a lovely crescent Moon is appears just below Saturn. Don’t confuse the planet with the star Spica as the two are now very similar in brightness. Saturn has the star Porrima to the right. </p>
   <p>We should mention Venus here although it all but invisible this month. Venus passed behind the Sun (from our point of view) on August 16. It will now enter the evening sky, but very slowly. This month it sets right after the Sun does. Venus will be better situation for viewing around October.</p>
   <p>Jupiter rises in the east-northeast about an hour after Saturn sets. Late in the month, that means 10pm! It is situated in the constellation Aries, to the lower left of the Great Square of Pegasus. Aries has no bright stars so you won’t miss Jupiter! And this month it grows in apparent size and brightness. On the 19th, a waning gibbous Moon is just above Jupiter.</p>

   <p>Mars rises near 2:30am all month in the foot of one of the Gemini twins. The magazines report that, on the evenings of August 6th and 7th, Mars will traverse the rich star cluster, M35, in Gemini. That will be quite a sight! Look for a waning crescent Moon to the right of Mars on the 25th.</p>
   <p>The planet Mercury finishes up its July show and swiftly moves into the morning sky this month. It is best seen by early risers later in August. On the 27th, a crescent Moon rises just before Mercury does, appearing to the upper right of the planet), rising at just after 5am. </p>
   <p>We should probably mention two oppositions this month. The first is the asteroid Vesta on August 5th. Vesta is the brightest of the asteroids, having been discovered back in 1807. It is also the second largest at over 300 miles in diameter. If you know where to look, you can see Vesta in binoculars in southern Capricornus – the heart-shaped constellation that follows the Teapot of Sagittarius across the sky. For most of August, you should look between the stars ? and 24 Capricorni. By the end of the month it is very near the star ? Capricorni. Vesta won’t be this bright again until the year 2018. Of course, the big news with Vesta is the visit by the Dawn spacecraft (see the photo). It will orbit Vesta for about a year before moving on to the dwarf planet Ceres. </p>
   <p>The other object is Neptune, which reaches opposition on the 22nd. This planet is located in western Aquarius and requires a finderchart. See the July issue of Sky & Telescope for the appropriate finder chart. </p>
   <p>Lastly, we’ll mention the Perseid Meteor Shower, which peaks on the morning of August 13. Looking at the table of Moon phases on the next page will show you that this is also the date of the full Moon. Too bad! The club has had meteor watching parties in the past that have commanded great attendance and much media attention. Only the brightest meteors will be seen this year as the Moon brightens the sky. Still, if you’re out camping, keep an eye out for the bright ones! </p>
