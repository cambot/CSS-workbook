This repository is a collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript examples created to gain basic, hands on knowledge.

Many of these examples were independently created based on, but not necessarily limited to: 
 - The tutorials in "Sams Teach Yourself CSS in 10 Minutes" 6th printing (2009)
 - JavaScript Phrasebook (Sam's Publishing)
